# FTC-Vision-Code
The vision code I wrote for the 2021-2022 FTC robotics season called Freight Frenzy. This program utilized OpenCV to detect objects during the game. 
It also includes code that involves the usage of an IMU's gyroscope to determine heading of our robot during the game as well as the usage of encoders 
to travel accurate distances autonomously.
